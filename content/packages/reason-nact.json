So why are we still programming like it's the 90s?\n\nInspired by the approaches taken by Akka and Erlang, nact is an open source Node.js framework which enables you to take control of your state to:\n         \n- more effectively use memory\n- improve application resiliance\n- increase performance\n- reduce coupling \n\nWith out of the box support for event sourcing, and a considered implementation of the actor model, nact can work across a wide variety of domains.\n\nNact is no silver bullet, but it is evolving to tackle ever more demanding use cases. Perhaps one of them is yours?\n\nTo get started, head to https://nact.io","analyzed":"2017-12-23T08:46:29.517Z","updated":"2017-12-23T08:46:29.517Z","stars":34,"score":0.6580437834927451,"quality":0.9598241457920539,"popularity":0.05741868501465412,"maintenance":1,"homepageUrl":"https://github.com/ncthbrt/reason-nact#readme","repositoryUrl":"https://github.com/ncthbrt/reason-nact","npmUrl":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/reason-nact","issuesUrl":"http://github.com/ncthbrt/reason-nact/issues","docsUrl":null}
