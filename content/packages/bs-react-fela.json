It even supports [React\nNative](http://fela.js.org/docs/guides/UsageWithReactNative.html).\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n    npm install --global bs-platform\n    yarn install\n\n### How to compile\n\n    yarn build\n\n### How to use (in your projects)\n\nRun:\n\n    yarn add --dev bs-react-fela\n\nto add the library to your project dependencies.
