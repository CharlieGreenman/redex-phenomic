{"type":"published","id":"immutable-re","name":"immutable-re","version":"0.0.15","description":"Persistent immutable collections for Reason","author":"Dave Bordoley","license":"BSD-3-Clause","keywords":["immutable","ocaml","reason"],"body":"![Immutable Collections For Reason](https://github.com/facebookincubator/immutable-re/raw/master/docs/images/logo-800x215.png?raw=true)\n===========================================================================\nPure [Reason](https://facebook.github.io/reason) implementation of persistent immutable data structures.\n\n# Features\nImmutable-re provides a complete set of efficient persistent immutable data\nstructures for [Reason](https://facebook.github.io/reason) and [OCaml](http://www.ocaml.org/),\ntargeting both OCaml native and byte code compilation modes, as well JavaScript using\n [BuckleScript](https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript).\n\nThe api includes concrete implementations of vectors, sets, and maps. Many\nimplementations support [transient mutability](http://clojure.org/reference/transients)\nfor efficient batch mutations. Additionally Immutable-re provides lazy\nfunctional iterators and sequences, along with type definitions for basic operators\nsuch as equality, comparison, and hashing.\n\nFor more details see the [API docs](http://facebookincubator.github.io/immutable-re/api.html).\n\n# Installing\n\n## Installing via NPM (JS Workflow)\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save immutable-re\n```\n\n## Installing `immutable` via OPAM (native workflow)\n\n```bash\n# On macOS, install opam via Homebrew:\nbrew update\nbrew install opam\n# On Linux, see here (you will need opam >= 1.2.2): http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html\n\nopam init\n# Add this to your ~/.bashrc (or ~/.zshrc):\n#   eval $(opam config env)\n\nopam update\nopam switch 4.02.3\neval $(opam config env)\nopam install immutable\n```\n\n## Contributing to development\n\n```bash\n# On macOS, install opam via Homebrew:\nbrew update\nbrew install opam\n# On Linux, see here (you will need opam >= 1.2.2): http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html\n\nopam init\n# Add this to your ~/.bashrc (or ~/.zshrc):\n#   eval $(opam config env)\n\nopam update\nopam switch 4.02.3\neval $(opam config env)\ngit clone git@github.com:facebookincubator/immutable-re.git\ncd immutable-re\nopam pin add -y immutable .\n```\n\n# Status\n\nImmutable-re is under active development and is not yet production ready. We are\nreleasing this early alpha to get community input and contributions. If you are\ninterested in contributing please follow the directions [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/immutable-re/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nFor JavaScript developers needing production ready immutable collections,\nwe recommend using the [Reason BuckleScript bindings to Immutable.js](https://github.com/BuckleTypes/bs-immutablejs.git).\n\nLicense\n-------\nImmutable-re is [BSD-licensed](https://github.com/facebookincubator/immutable-re/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).
