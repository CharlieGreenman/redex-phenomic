Feel free to create an issue or PR if you find anything missing.\n\n## Mutations\n\nThis binding takes an opinionated approach to mutations, e.g. `moment().add`, `moment().startOf`, and bind them with names like `mutableAdd` and `mutableStartOf`. To compensate that, there's an immutable version named `add` and `startOf` which takes a `moment().clone` first before applying the mutations.\n\n## Deprecations\n\nDeprecated methods (e.g. `moment().days` in favor of `moment().day`) are not included in this binding.","analyzed":"2017-12-15T16:02:21.246Z","updated":"2017-12-15T16:02:21.246Z","stars":10,"score":0.635663691065015,"quality":0.8691638181708617,"popularity":0.0713614969287283,"maintenance":0.999822919110576,"homepageUrl":"https://github.com/BuckleTypes/bs-moment#readme","repositoryUrl":"https://github.com/BuckleTypes/bs-moment","npmUrl":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/bs-moment","issuesUrl":"https://github.com/BuckleTypes/bs-moment/issues","docsUrl":null}
