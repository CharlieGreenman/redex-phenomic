JS objects can be a bit too flexible, and many Redux users rely on standardized shapes for their actions to make sure that middlewares and third party libraries work with them. Reason has language-level support for composing a set of data types which many functions can operate over. They are called [variants](https://reasonml.github.io/guide/language/data-types#variants) and you can see how they are used [here](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reductive/blob/master/examples/basic/simpleStore.re).\n\n### Action Creators\nRedux [action creators](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Actions.html#action-creators) are used as composable ways of generating plain JS objects that match the schema of a specific action. In Reason, the type system does a lot of this work for you, so you can reliably put action types directly in your code and know that things will Just Workâ„¢. This has an added performance advantage of shifting that function call to compile time.\n\n### Enhancer Composition\nMuch of the power of redux comes from having a unified API for writing and using middleware or enhancers. They're typically wired together behind the scenes in the [applyMiddlewares function](http://redux.js.org/docs/api/applyMiddleware.html). This function doesn't exist in Reductive, because Reason has language-level support for function composition with operators like [`|>` and `@@`](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Pervasives.html#6_Compositionoperators). You can see some [example usage here](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reductive/blob/master/examples/immutable/timeTravelStore.re#L86-L87) and [some of the deprecation messages](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reductive/blob/master/src/reductive.rei#L39-L112) to get a better understanding of typical usage.\n\n### The Source\nThe code behind Reductive is incredibly simple. The [first 40 lines](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reductive/blob/master/src/reductive.re#L1-L40) Include the entire reimplementation of [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux). The [next ~40 lines](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reductive/blob/master/src/reductive.re#L42-L83) are a reimplementation of the [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) library (without the higher-order component connect style implementation). The code is short and relatively simple to follow.\n\n## Alternative to Reductive\n\nHopefully, the above comparisons demonstrated that **you might not need an extra-react state management technique at all**; passing props down works well in [Reason-React](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react), and since props are well-typed, adding/remove them takes seconds. Keep state/props management simple so that you can spend the learning budget elsewhere!\n\n## Contributing\nCurrent needs:\n\n* Potential bug fixes\n* Better examples usages\n* More docs on differences from/similarities with Redux\n* Different examples of/links to simpler state management in Reason","analyzed":"2017-12-13T07:14:26.070Z","updated":"2017-12-13T07:14:26.070Z","score":0.3358120062240236,"quality":0.7194824689455002,"popularity":0.00943028249630538,"maintenance":0.3333333333333333,"npmUrl":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/reductive","docsUrl":null}
