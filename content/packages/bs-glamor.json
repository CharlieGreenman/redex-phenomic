{"type":"published","id":"bs-glamor","name":"bs-glamor","version":"0.1.3","description":"BuckleScript bindings for glamor","author":"Jan Poeschko","license":"ISC","keywords":["css","glamor","bucklescript","reason"],"body":"# bs-glamor â€“ [BuckleScript](https://github.com/bloomberg/bucklescript) bindings for [glamor](https://github.com/threepointone/glamor)\n\nThe API is still **experimental**. Only the `css` function from glamor is exposed (with its result slightly incorrectly typed as a `string`); no other functions such as `renderStatic` are supported yet.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save bs-glamor\n```\n\nIn your `bsconfig.json`, include `\"bs-glamor\"` in the `bs-dependencies`.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe following examples (in [Reason](https://facebook.github.io/reason) syntax) assume that `Glamor` is included in the namespace:\n\n```reason\nopen Glamor;\n```\n\n* Simple styling:\n\n    ```reason\n    css [\n        color \"red\",\n        border \"1px solid black\"\n    ]\n    ```\n\n* Styling with selectors (`@media`, `:hover`, `&`, etc.):\n\n    ```reason\n    css [\n        color \"red\",\n        Selector \"@media (min-width: 300px)\" [\n            color \"green\"\n        ]\n    ]\n    ```\n\n* Selectors can be nested:\n\n    ```reason\n    css [\n        color \"red\",\n        Selector \"@media (min-width: 300px)\" [\n            color \"green\",\n            Selector \"& .foo\" [\n                color \"blue\"\n            ]\n        ]\n    ]\n    ```\n\nYou can isolate inclusion of the `Glamor` namespace in the following way:\n\n```reason\nGlamor.(css [color \"red\"])\n```\n\nThe result of the `css` function can be assigned to a class name, e.g. in JSX:\n\n```reason\n<div className=(css [color \"red\"]) />\n```\n\n## Example\n\nSee [reason-react-tictactoe](https://github.com/poeschko/reason-react-tictactoe) for a live example.\n\n## Development\n\n```sh\nnpm run start\n```\n\n### Tests\n\nThere are some simplistic tests using [bs-jest](https://github.com/BuckleTypes/bs-jest).\n\n```sh\nnpm run test\n```\n\n## Thanks\n\nThanks to [reason-react-example](https://github.com/chenglou/reason-react-example), [reason-react](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react), and [bs-jest](https://github.com/BuckleTypes/bs-jest) for inspiration how to create a Reason library, and of course, thanks to [glamor](https://github.com/threepointone/glamor).","analyzed":"2017-12-14T16:36:22.262Z","updated":"2017-12-14T16:36:22.262Z","stars":45,"score":0.6002183012277538,"quality":0.7447304008767317,"popularity":0.09108360245619977,"maintenance":0.9854854860144695,"homepageUrl":"https://github.com/poeschko/bs-glamor#readme","repositoryUrl":"https://github.com/poeschko/bs-glamor","npmUrl":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/bs-glamor","issuesUrl":"https://github.com/poeschko/bs-glamor/issues","docsUrl":null}
